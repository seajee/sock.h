# sock.h

A simple C socket library wrapper. Supporting TCP and UDP via IPv4 and IPv6.

For more added simplicity, the library is written in a single header library
style.

## Quick start

There are many examples in the repository that show how this library
simplifies the usage of sockets in C. To build them you can use the Makefile
provided.

```console
make
```
